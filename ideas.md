- `tedlt mine` to fetch user assigned tickets ?
- bulk ticket creation: `tedlt create "Fix bug" "Add feature" "Update docs" -p work`
- `tedlt init` to create initial config file
- `tedlt history` to show recently created tickets, cache them somehow ?
- `tedlt create --dry-run "Test ticket"` to preview ticket creation without actually creating it

TODO:
