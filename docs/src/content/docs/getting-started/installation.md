## Download

Download the latest release for your platform from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/brequet/tedlt/releases/latest).

tedlt is available on all major platforms.

## Building from Source

If you prefer to build from source or your platform isn't supported, simply build it from source using Rust's Cargo tool:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/brequet/tedlt.git
```

## Verify Installation

After installation, verify tedlt is working:

```sh
tedlt --version
```

You should see output like:

```
tedlt 0.1.4
```

## Next Steps

Now that tedlt is installed, continue to the [Quick Start Guide](/tedlt/getting-started/quick-start/) to set up your Jira credentials and create your first ticket.
