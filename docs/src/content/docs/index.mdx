## Why tedlt?

Creating Jira tickets shouldn't require opening a browser, navigating multiple pages, and filling out countless forms. **tedlt** lets you create tickets with a single command—just provide a title, and you're done.

```sh
tedlt create "Fix login page error"
```

That's it. Your ticket is created.

## Quick Example

**Without tedlt**: Open browser → Navigate to Jira → Click "Create" → Select project → Select issue type → Select component → Select fix version → Enter title → Click "Create"

**With tedlt**: One command. That's it.

### Your Configuration (`tedlt.jsonc`)

```jsonc
{
  "jira_url": "https://acmecorp.atlassian.net",
  "project_key": "SHOP",
  "properties": {
    "defaultEpic": "SHOP-42",        // Shopping Cart Epic
    "defaultVersion": "10523",       // Q1 2024 Release
    "issueTypes": {
      "story": "10001",
      "bug": "10004",
      "task": "10002"
    }
  },
  "profiles": {
    "default": { // Default profile applied to all tickets
      "fields": {
        "parent": { "id": "${defaultEpic}" },
        "fixVersions": [{ "id": "${defaultVersion}" }],
        "issuetype": { "id": "${issueTypes.story}" }
      }
    },
    "backend": {
      "fields": {
        "components": [{ "id": "11001" }]  // Backend Component
      }
    },
    "frontend": {
      "fields": {
        "components": [{ "id": "11002" }]  // Frontend Component
      }
    },
    "bug": {
      "fields": {
        "issuetype": { "id": "${issueTypes.bug}" },
        "priority": { "id": "3" }  // High priority
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Create Tickets Instantly

```sh
# Simple story - uses default profile
tedlt create "Add shopping cart checkout button"
# ✓ Created SHOP-156 (Story, under SHOP-42, targeted for Q1 2024)

# Backend bug - combines 'bug' + 'backend' profiles
tedlt create "Payment API timeout" --profile bug --profile backend
# ✓ Created SHOP-157 (Bug, Backend component, High priority)
```

### Discover Your Jira Setup

```sh
# Find project details, components, issue types, and versions
tedlt info project SHOP

# List epics in your project to find the right parent
tedlt info epics --project-key SHOP

# Inspect a ticket to see its raw JSON structure, useful for creating profiles from existing tickets
tedlt info ticket SHOP-123

# List available boards
tedlt info boards --project SHOP

# View available fields for a specific issue type
tedlt info fields --project-key SHOP --issue-type 10001
```

## How It Works

1. **Configure once**: Set up your Jira credentials and default settings
2. **Define profiles**: Create profiles for common ticket types (bugs, features, tasks)
3. **Create tickets**: Use profiles to create tickets with a single command
4. **Discover metadata**: Query Jira for project info, field IDs, and more

## What Makes tedlt Different?

- **Title-first philosophy**: Most tickets start with a good title. Fill in details later if needed.
- **Configuration as code**: Your ticket templates live in config files.
- **Composable profiles**: Combine multiple profiles for maximum flexibility.
- **Developer-friendly**: Built for command-line workflows and automation.
