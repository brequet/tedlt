## Why tedlt?

TODO: the true purpose of tedlt is to create jira ticket with several fields defined at once using extensive configuration (profiles etc), but you are right: dont explain too much and keep it light here.
Creating Jira tickets shouldn't require opening a browser, navigating multiple pages, and filling out countless forms. **tedlt** lets you create tickets with a single command—just provide a title, and you're done.

```sh
tedlt create "Fix login page error"
```

That's it. Your ticket is created.

## Quick Example

```sh
# Create a simple ticket
tedlt create "Update documentation"

# Create a bug with the 'bug' profile
tedlt create "Fix null pointer exception" --profile bug

# Create a critical bug (inherits from bug profile + adds urgency)
tedlt create "Production outage" --profile bug-critical

# Create a task for on another board (multiple profiles supported)
tedlt create "Design new feature" --profile proj2 --profile task

# Discover project information
tedlt info project MYPROJ

# View ticket details
tedlt info ticket MYPROJ-123
```

## How It Works

1. **Configure once**: Set up your Jira credentials and default settings
2. **Define profiles**: Create profiles for common ticket types (bugs, features, tasks)
3. **Create tickets**: Use profiles to create tickets with a single command
4. **Discover metadata**: Query Jira for project info, field IDs, and more

## What Makes tedlt Different?

- **Title-first philosophy**: Most tickets start with a good title. Fill in details later if needed.
- **Configuration as code**: Your ticket templates live in config files.
- **Composable profiles**: Combine multiple profiles for maximum flexibility.
- **Developer-friendly**: Built for command-line workflows and automation.
